## Instructions to Compile and Run the Code

## Compilation

Both **Question 1 (Q1)** and **Question 2 (Q2)** contain a `main.c` file as the entry point for execution. To compile the code, navigate to the respective project directory (Q1 or Q2) and use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o a.out main.c
```

This command will generate an executable file named `main` in the current directory.

## Execution

After successful compilation, the code can be executed by running the following command:

```bash
./a.out
```

Ensure that all required input files are present in the appropriate directories before running the program.
